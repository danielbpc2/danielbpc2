Put you feet up, grab a bit of wine and get cozy by the fireplace!


I'm a ex-lawyer who always had interest in technology and gaming, trying to chase these passions I went through the Le Wagon bootcamp, where they teach full stack web development, there I've acquired the knowledge to keep improving myself.

I got a bachelor in computer science! 🚀🚀

Right now I'm focusing in acquiring experience and learn new things!

- 👔 I’m currently working at Aramis as a Senior Node/React/Next developer! 
- 💻 I’m always looking for new things to learn, right now I'm getting deeper into Next.js 🚀
- 📫 You can reach me at my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielbpc/)
