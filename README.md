Put you feet up, grab a bit of wine and get cozy but the fireplace!


I'm a ex-lawyer who always had interest in technology and gaming, trying to chase these passions I went through the Le Wagon bootcamp, where they teach full stack web development, there I've acquired the knowledge to keep improving myself.

Got into UNIFG university, with the focus to acquire a bachelor of computer science with to further develop my knowledge! 🚀🚀

Right now I'm focusing in acquiring experience and learn new things!

- 👔 I’m currently working on Accenture as a Node/React developer! 
- 💻 I’m always looking for new things to learn, right now I'm getting deeper into node/react/reactNative 🚀
